# Week 11

## Summary
* This week we learned about Parallax scrolling in a website. This was a very interesting technique for building websites and was fun to use for my site this week. I used the basic concept of it to create a photography website consisting of pictures I have personally taken. The colors I tried to go with were a monochromatic color scheme of green.
## Steps
*To create this website I first started with the idea of what images to use then moved on to creating the html and created an order to what was going to be used. I mainly put in the text “place holder” in all the areas that I wanted there to be a text so that when I created the css file I could see when I refreshed the webpage where all the text will be and how they would look before filling it in. After that I just tweaked everything to make it to my liking with some changes to stuff that I thought would be great additions but ultimately didn’t pan out.
## Problems
*I didn’t necessarily have many problems this week with the assignment. I generally was trying to do some extra mile stuff with my site but I could not get it to look how I imagined so I ended up dropping the extra ideas and just left the site how it should be.
## Overall
*After this week I see it pretty clear that I really like these ideas for websites and will most likely use the formats for future sights because of how simple yet interesting they are.
