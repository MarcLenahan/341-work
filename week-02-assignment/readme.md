* This weeks homework cycle I have completed downloading different applications for text editors and
 git applications to understand the basics of using both.

* In order to complete this assignment I had to narrow down which applications I would
 feel best working with to write out and push repositories. The applications I ended up using were
 Atom for the text editor and using Sourcetree to commit comments for the git versions and lastly used
 GitHub desktop application to post to GitHub.com.

* I ended up having a lot of problems when completing this assignment but I also had a lot of success
looking up the problems online and through the wiki and other classmates issues. Unfortunately I never
managed to post my own issues which is something I plan to do more now that I am becoming more familiar
with this process.

* I have learned a lot and I want to further understand the applications that will be used in this class
which means that I may have to post more issues or email the instructors.

* As a result of my problems I was not able to help out other classmates. I do realize though that is
a big part of this class and will also help out myself by practicing out these assignments as much
as possible.
