        Inspirational Quote
      </div>
      <div class="aside-text">
        <p>“The attraction of snowboarding is the freedom it gives you. With a snowboard
          on your feet the sky is the limit. You can do anything and go anywhere. This is
          not just for pro riders. It is for everyone. The other amazing thing with
          snowboarding is how easy it is to get away from people and enjoy the solitude
          of the mountains. Its almost impossible in surfing but with snowboarding it is
          a short hike from the top of the lift or the side of the road.”

    <h1>Types of Snowboards</h1>
    <h2>All-mountain</h2>
    <p>Best for any terrain and conditions. All-mountain snowboards perform anywhere on a
      mountain—groomed runs, backcountry, even park and pipe. They may be directional
      (meaning downhill only) or twin-tip (for riding switch, meaning either direction).
      Most boarders ride all-mountain boards. Because of their versatility, all-mountain
      boards are good for beginners who are still learning what terrain they like.</p>

    <h2>Freestyle</h2>
    <p>Best for a playful ride in and out of the park. Freestyle snowboards are light, short
      and flexible with twin tips. They are good for riders who want a lively ride anywhere
      on the mountain, or those who like to push their limits in terrain parks; they’re not
      so good for stability or cruising fast on hard snow.</p>

    <h2>Splitboard</h2>
    <p>Best for climbing in the backcountry. These backcountry-specific boards split in half
      to create 2 skis and permit climbing on untracked backcountry slopes. You later
      reconnect the halves and ride downhill. It’s a great design for adventurous backcountry
      devotees who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to safely explore unpatrolled
      slopes. You'll also need climbing skins and a split kit, usually sold separately.</p>
