      <p class="part-one">It was march 25th, on the way back from a trip around the northwest. Mason was so
        happy with everything he has accomplished in the last 7 days. Spent time with
        his closes friends he got to see some of the most magnificent places he has ever
        witnessed.</p>

      <p class="part-two">After visiting each state, he was in he thought the best way to hold on to the
        memories was to collect a shot glass from that state that signified the status of
        the trip. The one shot glass that stood out the most was oddly enough from Idaho.
        Idaho was the beginning and end of the trip and held up as the start to a great
        week and the perfect ending to it. The shot glass was clear with a graphic of a
        cartoon bear.</p>

      <p class="part-three">The bear was holding up a sign that ironically said look out for bears. It was a
        funny image that always brought a smile to Mason. Inside the shot glass however,
        was the real reason he bought the glass. It was a little plastic figure of a bear.
        The outside of the glass said save the bear, which was a little context to drinking
        the shot. Every time he took a shot with his friends he always choose that glass
        because to him it was the best one.</p>

      <p class="part-four">7 days of having the best memories and he finally came home. After a long trip,
        it took a couple of days to get everything he brought clean. It finally came time to
        cleaning the glassware he bought on the trip. Mason was running low on time for he
        had to go to work. He left it out hoping that someone will clean it for him.</p>

      <p class="part-five">Unfortunately, the person to do the good deed didnâ€™t understand that this glassware
        is not machine washable. He placed it in the lower rack where everyone knows that
        is where you put the dirtiest dishes because it has the most water to wash it. At the
        end of the wash another friend pulled it out knowing the history of it and saw that
        the bear, has broken off from the glass.</p>

      <p class="part-six">Feeling sad himself he told mason and both wondered who would do such a thing to a
        glass that meant so much. Not knowing who loaded the dish washer they wondered
        endlessly. The take away they want to have people know was to always check what you
        are putting in the dishwasher is ok to go in it. If not hand wash it, please.</p>
