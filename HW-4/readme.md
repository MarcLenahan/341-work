* For this week assignment I was to create two web pages that are linked together about a recipe. Within this assignment, I was to implement html I learned over the week which included Semantic Markup, creating links, and creating lists. To complete this assignment, I needed to use everything that was included in the lesson plan.

* The first steps I did was creating both web pages so I would have two places to go back and forth to see how things will work together. After I just filled in each page with what I thought would be appropriate to make it look like what the assignment was asking for. When it came down to the second page and using all the semantic markup I kind of made a list of all the different ones I was supposed to use then implement them one after another.

* I did not have really any issues with this one assignment. I looked at what was asked and kind of planned out the simplest way to have it done while also reaching every point that was needed.
