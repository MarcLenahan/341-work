* This weeks homework cycle I have completed writing my own website and publishing it online for everyone to see. This also included writing a poem within the webpage as well.

* In order to complete this assignment I had to follow the instructions from the Web Dev site to help me through it. I managed to put together the last part of the assignment using little bits learned from the site as well.

* I ended up working on this assignment early on but I lost track later in the week which made things complicated. I actually didn't know what solved what but I still ended up turning in the assignment late. I believe I will be taking a different approach to assignments for now on based on some of the things I am having most trouble on.

* Despite my setbacks I did manage to learn a lot about creating a website using markup and html. it was very interesting and because of my problems I intend to work harder on these topics to make sure that I will better understand projects down the road.
